    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large
        frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the mince and season with salt
        and pepper, then fry for 10 minutes, breaking up the mince with a wooden
        spoon as it cooks, until browned all over. Remove the mince from the pan
        and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the pan to a medium heat and add the remaining 2 tablespoon of
        oil along with the chopped onion, garlic, celery and carrot. Season
        again with salt and pepper, then cook for about 10 minutes, stirring
        often, until the vegetables are slightly softened and look glossy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the mince to the pan and add the dried herbs and tinned tomatoes.
        Fill the empty tin one-quarter full with cold water, swill around and
        tip into the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring everything to a simmer, check the seasoning and add a little more
        salt and pepper if needed, then turn off the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the white sauce, whisk together the mascarpone, ricotta, milk
        and 100g/3Â½oz of the cheddar in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble the lasagne, pour one-third of the white sauce into the
        bottom of your slow cooker, top with 3 lasagne sheets, breaking up as
        necessary to cover the meat. Spoon over one-third of the meat sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat the layers with the remaining sauces and pasta sheets, finishing
        with the meat sauce. Sprinkle the top with the remaining cheddar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook on high for 3 hours or low for 5 hours. By the end of cooking the
        pasta sheets should be tender and the centre of the lasagne piping hot.
      </li>
      <li>Just before serving, garnish with the fresh basil, if using.</li>
    </ol>
