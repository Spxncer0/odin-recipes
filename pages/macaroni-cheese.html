    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>250g/9oz macaroni</li>
      <li>40g/1½oz butter</li>
      <li>40g/1½ plain flour</li>
      <li>600ml/20fl oz milk</li>
      <li>250g/9oz cheddar, grated</li>
      <li>50g/2oz Parmesan, finely grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the macaroni in a large saucepan of boiling salted water for 8–10
        minutes. Drain well and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the butter over a medium heat in a saucepan slightly larger than
        that used for the macaroni. Add the flour and stir to form a roux,
        cooking for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually whisk in the milk, a little at a time. Cook for 10–15 minutes
        to a thickened and smooth sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, preheat the grill to hot.</li>
      <li>
        Remove the sauce from the hob, add 175g/6oz of the cheddar and stir
        until it is well combined and melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the macaroni to the sauce and mix well. Transfer to a deep
        suitably-sized ovenproof dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle over the remaining cheddar and the Parmesan and place the dish
        under the hot grill. Cook until the cheese is browned and bubbling.
        Serve straightaway.
      </li>
